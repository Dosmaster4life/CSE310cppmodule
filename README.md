# Overview

{PassPhrase is a program that generates pass phrases and saves them for the user to view later. }

{PassPhrase does the following, 
1. Prompts the user how many words they want in a pass phrase
2. Searches a file and selects random pass phrases
3. Displays the pass phrase
4. Prompts the user to ask what filename they want.
5. Saves the passphrase to a file
6. Repeats if the user wants to create more pass phrases.
}

{This software was developed to help users create unique pass phrases. Often hardware wallets for crypto currency have pass phrases as a backup if the user forgot their password. PassPhrase will create unique pass phrases based on how many words the user wants in their phrase.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
